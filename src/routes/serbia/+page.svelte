    <h1>Serbian Culture</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            My mom immigrated from Bijeljina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1990, just before the war broke out. Growing up in Utah, I always knew I was Serbian, but my exposure to the culture was limited. My grandparents visited us yearly, and from those visits, I learned the basics of the Serbian languageâ€”though I mostly understood it in the context of household conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
            During high school, I started visiting Serbia and Bosnia every summer, spending 1-2 weeks there each time. Each trip brought me closer to the language and the culture, and over time, I became more comfortable with it. About two years ago, I decided to take it a step further and enrolled in a language class. Now, I dedicate around 10 hours a week to improving my Serbian through assignments, conversations with relatives, and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mom's journey has been a huge inspiration for me, and I feel deeply proud to reconnect with my Serbian roots. Learning the language, experiencing the culture firsthand, and growing closer to my grandparents have been a beautiful gift that I cherish every day.
